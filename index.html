            repository. 3 options:<br>
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Use <a href="https://github.com/">git</a>.&nbsp; This
              allows you to have a version controlled copy of this
              complete site repository on your local computer that can
              always be kept up to date and in sync with the master
              version.&nbsp; It takes a little work to learn how to do
              this, but there are many <a
                href="https://guides.github.com/">resources</a>
              online.&nbsp; This is the recommended procedure and is a
              good excuse to learn how to use this powerful version
              control tool.</li>
            <li>Download the entire repository as a compressed .zip
              (more for Windows) or .tar.gz (more for Linux) file by
              clicking the buttons to the right.&nbsp; This allows you
              to get all of the content without having to learn git, but
              your copy won't be kept in sync with the master; it is
              just a one-time snapshot.</li>
            <li>You can download an individual file by simply opening
              the file in github, then clicking the "Raw" button on the
              upper right of the display pane.&nbsp; Thus the "raw" file
              will be downloaded to your computer (or if it is text it
              will be displayed to your browser window, where you can
              save it).&nbsp; GitHub doesn't make this option
              particularly obvious because they want to encourage people
              to use the version control capabilities of git.<br>

          <h3>Welcome to Making Makers!</h3>
          <p>This course is meant to be an introduction to the maker
            movement from the bottom up. There are many books, kits,
            courses, and websites available that provide excellent
            introductions to electronics, particularly using the popular
            Arduino micro-controller that we will use. However, this
            course will explore the physics of actuators and sensors
            that can be controlled and interfaced with an Arduino. By
            exploring the physical principles and designing and building
            examples, we will obtain a deeper picture of how things work
            and why. By interfacing with the Robot Garden hacker-space,
            the student will be introduced to a network and support
            group that will enable and enhance his future maker
            endeavors. Several guest maker show-and-tells will be
            scheduled throughout the course.</p>

          Also called Hobbyists. The term is popular in the open
