For efficiency, before the class please fill out the [Robot Garden waiver](http://www.robotgarden.org/get-involved/waiver/). Be advised that it will often throw an error when you submit, but that just means it worked. :)

Octoprint is a web interface that Robot Garden uses to control its 3D printers.  Please read the [Robot Garden Octoprint page](https://github.com/RobotGarden/octoprint/blob/master/intro_to_octoprint.asciidoc) for information on how this works.  This will greatly facilitate you learning how to use the 3D printers at Robot Garden.

[Meetup](meetup.com) is an excellent way to find out about meetings and goings-on at Robot Garden and with other groups you might be interested in.
