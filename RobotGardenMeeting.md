# Class at Robot Garden

On Tuesday March 1st we will meet at Robot Garden at 6:00 pm.  Robot Garden is located at [2324 2nd Street in Livermore](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Robot+Garden,+Second+Street,+Livermore,+CA/2350+Railroad+Ave,+Livermore,+CA+94550/@37.6829176,-121.7682435,18z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x808fe0dca4618efd:0x75d4323f44065d31!2m2!1d-121.7675007!2d37.6818331!1m5!1m1!1s0x808fe7a1b5ca437d:0x7e27239870aa0edc!2m2!1d-121.768259!2d37.684367!3e2). This link shows the (4 minute) walking directions from the parking garage on Railroad Ave.

For efficiency, before the class please fill out the [Robot Garden waiver](http://www.robotgarden.org/get-involved/waiver/). Be advised that it will often throw an error when you submit, but that just means it worked. :smiley:  **Please note:** you _must be 18 years of age_ to be a full member of Robot Garden (the waiver will ask your date of birth).  If you are not 18 years of age, we will prorate your student membership to Robot Garden accordingly.

We will try to have a Safety and Basic Use (SBU) class on the laser cutter and possibly the 3D printers during our class.  You can find all of the SBU materials [here](http://www.robotgarden.org/workshop/safety-and-basic-use/).  Please take the time to preview these materials prior to class.

Octoprint is a web interface that Robot Garden uses to control its 3D printers.  Please read the [Robot Garden Octoprint page](https://github.com/RobotGarden/octoprint/blob/master/intro_to_octoprint.asciidoc) for information on how this works.  This will greatly facilitate you learning how to use the 3D printers at Robot Garden.

[Meetup](http://www.meetup.com) is an excellent way to find out about meetings and goings-on at Robot Garden and with other groups you might be interested in.  Signing up for a Meetup account and adding Robot Garden will allow you to be alerted about upcoming events at Robot Garden.  In lieu of signing up, you can also check-out [Robot Garden's Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Robot-Garden/events/) to see a listing of upcoming events.
