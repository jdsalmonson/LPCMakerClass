An export from FreeCAD of the cut-out plans in "Flattened SVG" format:

The Microsoft format (printed by Inkscape) of the Flattened SVG format.  This is what you open in the Full Spectrum laser cutter softwar:
  Robot1b_flattened.xps

There is also a version of the cut-out plans with only the big shapes (excluding bolt and axle holes).
This is because the little parts tend to cut quicker, so this version can be used to just cut the bigger parts, if a few extra passes are desired.
